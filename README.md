# DoodleVerse - Unleashed by HEXORA

## Project Breakdown

**DoodleVerse** is a sleek, ruthless single-page portfolio built to showcase my skills and projects with precision and impact. Clean. Dark. Sharp. Every section strikes hard — from **About** to **Portfolio**, my work takes the stage without compromise. Client-side validation? Tight. Navigation? Smooth like a knife. This isn’t just a website — it’s my statement to the world.

## Features That Slam

* **Responsive AF:** Desktop, tablet, mobile — this beast adapts and dominates.
* **Navigation Like a Pro:** Pure **Vanilla JS** magic. No reloads, no delays, just instant transitions.
* **Sections With Bite:** **About**, **Resume**, **Portfolio**, **Contact** — each built for maximum impact.
* **Testimonial Hardcore:** Pop-up modals that flex client feedback without clutter.
* **Form Validation:** Clean, client-side checks — no weak entries allowed.
* **Dark & Deadly:** Bold **dark theme**, killer typography (**Poppins**), readability like a sniper’s scope.

## Technologies That Power the Beast

* **HTML5:** Built strong, semantic, no nonsense.
* **CSS3:** Fully responsive, maintainable, lethal styling with **CSS Variables**.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Raw, pure, fast — nothing slows it down.
* **Ionicons:** Sharp, scalable icons to punctuate every move.

## Installation / Setup

Own it locally. Clone it, open it, flex it. Simple as that.

1. **Clone the Repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adi29x/PORTFOLIO-DoodleVerse.git
    ```
2. **Step Inside**
    ```bash
    cd PORTFOLIO-DoodleVerse
    ```
3. **Launch**
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```
Done. No excuses.

## Usage

Sidebar navigation is your arsenal. Forms validate like a hawk, but if you want submissions to actually hit your inbox, hook up a backend (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or your own API). Don’t cheat the system.
